# Safe Decentralized Identity System

An experimental Safe fallbackHandler to add the `did:dis` DID prototype.

**Why?**

The `did:pkh` DID standard isn't scalable, because you can't update the underlying DID document. It's static. And that's bad because you're stuck with one signing/verifying key.

The proposed `did:dis` DID standard overcomes these limits, while minimizing the cost of generation. Using EIP-3886 the smart contract can communicate with an offchain service, which hosts the DID document and thus not requiring any onchain transactions to update.

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) tutorial.

### Format

Format the contracts:

```sh
$ forge fmt
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

Lint the contracts:

```sh
$ pnpm lint
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```sh
$ forge test
```

Generate test coverage and output result to the terminal:

```sh
$ pnpm test:coverage
```

Generate test coverage with lcov report (you'll have to open the `./coverage/index.html` file in your browser, to do so
simply copy paste the path):

```sh
$ pnpm test:coverage:report
```

## Notes

1. Foundry uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to manage dependencies. For
   detailed instructions on working with dependencies, please refer to the
   [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/dependencies.html) in the book
2. You don't have to create a `.env` file, but filling in the environment variables may be useful when debugging and
   testing against a fork.
